# PolyFit: Clip-art vectorization
Code & Data for the SIGGRAPH 2020 paper [PolyFit: Perception-Aligned Vectorization of Raster Clip-art via Intermediate Polygonal Fitting](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2020/ClipArtVectorization/)

The code has only been tested on Windows x64 with the Visual Studio 2017 compiler, for other platforms the active issue is [here](https://github.com/dedoardo/polyfit/issues/4). 

We have a [pre-release executable](https://github.com/dedoardo/polyfit/releases/tag/prerelease-paper) available as well.

## Building
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/dedoardo/polyfit`

Open the folder or CMake generated solution in Visual Studio (use a 2017 compiler) and build polyfit.exe in Release(WithDebInfo) mode, the output will be written to the cmake source directory.

## Running
`polyfit.exe "data/binary_input/pear-32/input.png" "trained/random_forest_paper.txt" curves-fill.svg`

The output will be written to `curves-fill.svg`

If you are interested in visualizing different stages of the algorithm, build `polyfit_stages.cpp` instead and uncomment the respective lines relatives to the stages you are interested in visualizing. The usage is identical, except for the last argument which is a directory where the various stages will be written to as svgs.

## Data
All the results shown in the paper and used in the user study are contained in the data directory.

If you want to generate all the results as shown in the paper, copy the polyfit.exe executable in the root directory and run the following Python3 script. Alternatively, you can obtain the executable from one of the releases.

`python scripts/run_data_baseline.py`

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following libraries, but they should be handled automatically through git submodule.
- [Eigen 3.3+](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [Andre's Random Forest](https://github.com/bjoern-andres/random-forest)
- [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/download/)
- [Sean Barret's stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

## Some of the known problems
- Complex pixel-art will likely not work as the multicolor code hasn't been tested on it.
- Visual Studio 2019 *might* not work, we encountered some problems with incorrect variable initialization.

## TODOs
- Add instructions for training data
- Debug pixel-art
